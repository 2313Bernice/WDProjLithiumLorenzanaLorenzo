    <p> Starbucks began in 1971 in Seattle, Washington, inside the busy and historic Pike Place Market. 
        During this time, specialty coffee was rare in the United States, and most people relied on instant 
        coffee sold in supermarkets. The three founders, Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl, wanted
        to change how Americans experienced coffee. They were inspired by the craftsmanship of European coffee
        traditions and believed that high quality beans could elevate everyday life. Their shop originally 
        focused only on selling whole coffee beans, tea, and equipment rather than selling drinks.</p>

    <p> The founders learned the art of roasting from Alfred Peet, the owner of Peet’s Coffee and Tea in California. 
        Peet introduced them to stronger roasts and premium beans sourced from trusted growers. His influence shaped 
        the early identity of Starbucks, which was built on careful sourcing and bold, rich flavors. The brand’s unique 
        name came from a character in the novel "Moby-Dick," which reflected the founders’ shared love for adventure and
         the sea. This early identity emphasized tradition, quality, and a close connection to global coffee origins.</p>

    <p> Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Starbucks expanded gradually around Seattle. A major turning point 
        came when Howard Schultz joined the company after being captivated by the atmosphere of their stores. During 
        a trip to Italy, he discovered the culture of espresso bars and envisioned Starbucks as a place where people 
        could gather, study, or relax while enjoying handcrafted coffee drinks. His idea transformed the company from
         a small roastery into a global coffeehouse. This shift eventually led Starbucks to become one of the most 
         recognizable brands in the world, combining community spirit with its passion for exceptional coffee.</p>

    <p> The first Starbucks store ever established remains at Pike Place Market, still operating today as a tourist landmark. 
        As Starbucks expanded globally, it entered the Philippines in 1997, opening its first branch in 6750 Ayala Avenue, Makati.
        This made the Philippines one of the earliest countries in Asia to welcome the brand. Since then, Starbucks has grown 
        into hundreds of branches nationwide and is widely known as a favorite place for studying, working, and relaxing while
         enjoying handcrafted drinks.</p> <!-- information about the 1st Starbucks in the Philippines -->
