### Description: 

#### Starbucks is known for its high-quality coffee and its warm and inviting atmosphere. Each drink is brewed with attention and precision, down to the very care they put when harvesting their authentic coffee beans from their Coffee Belt around the world. The establishments itself are meant to serve as a ‘third-place’ atmosphere for customers, an inviting and accessible place where they can relax, socialize, work, and feel comfortable with a drink to accompany them. This website is meant to encapsulate that atmosphere, giving users an overview as to how Starbucks came to be, their process of collecting their authentic coffee beans, different branches of SB in the Philippines, and their menu. This website also allows for an immersive experience where users can study or relax through a digital Starbucks.  

#### We chose to make this the main focus of our website not only because of the variations of topics we can cover, but also because of our own personal experiences with Starbucks. As avid coffee lovers, their coffees offer a wide range of choices that makes it so that we are not limited to just a few flavors of coffee. They also offer other varieties of drinks such as refreshers for those who do not drink coffee or those who wish to drink something else. Starbucks is also our go-to hangout place, whether it is for hanging out with friends or a comfortable atmosphere to work on requirements. With these personal experiences, we wish to connect with other coffee lovers and help people find a place of comfort– like how Starbucks is a place of comfort for us.

### Implementation of JavaScript: 

#### We will implement JavaScript into our website via the use of JS in Webpage 5 (Study at SB). JavaScript will be used in order to code the timer that will serve as our Pomodoro clock as well as the timer for both short and long break. We will also use JavaScript to allow the user to change the background image and alarm audio of Webpage 5 based on the image/alarm that they click.
