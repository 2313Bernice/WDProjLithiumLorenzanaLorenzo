    <h1> Brewing with Starbucks </h1>

    <p> Starbucks is known for its high-quality coffee and its warm and inviting atmosphere. 
        Each drink is brewed with attention and precision, down to the very care they put when harvesting their 
        authentic coffee beans from their Coffee Belt around the world. The establishments itself are meant to serve 
        as a ‘third-place’ atmosphere for customers, an inviting and accessible place where they can relax, socialize, work, 
        and feel comfortable with a drink to accompany them. This website is meant to encapsulate that atmosphere, giving users 
        an overview as to how Starbucks came to be, their process of collecting their authentic coffee beans, different branches of 
        SB in the Philippines, and their menu. This website also allows for an immersive experience where users can study or relax 
        through a digital Starbucks.</p>
